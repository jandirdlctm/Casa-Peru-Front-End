# casa_peru

## Project Description
This project is a website for the restaurant Casa Peru located in Salt Lake City. Casa Peru is a small family owned business that built their clientele by word of mouth. This website showcases the peruvian cuisine, with professional images. The website also allows users to post reviews and share their experience at the restaurant. This website is user friendly and responsive. In the front end I used HTML CSS and VueJS.
